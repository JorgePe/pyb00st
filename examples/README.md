# Examples for pyb00st

On my computer, my scripts requires sudo permissions to access my HCI controller.

Since I'm still developping I don't have the libraries/packages where python expects
so I need to set PYTHONPATH environment variable:

On Linux:

```
export PYTHONPATH='/home/.../pyb00st/'
```

On Windows:

```
set %PYTHONPATH%="C:/Users/.../pyb00st/"
```
