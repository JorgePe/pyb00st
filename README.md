Python for LEGO BOOST

This is totally crazy but I'm trying to write a python package.

Goal is to use it with ev3dev on MINDSTORMS EV3 so only python3.

Will also be tested with Ubuntu (I'm using 17.04 on a x64 laptop) and occasionally on Raspberry Pi
(mainly ev3dev but also Raspbian; only RPi 3 and RPi Zero W, but should work on other models).

Why pyb00st? Well, boost is a C++ library and there are already lots of python libraries related to
it and I don't want to add the LEGO word because I don't want troubles.

By the way...
