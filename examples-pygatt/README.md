# Examples for pyb00st based on pygatt

On my computer, my scripts requires sudo permissions to access my HCI controller.

Since I'm still developping I dont have the libraries/packages where pyhton expects.
I change between pygattlib and pygatt versions by setting PYTHONPATH environment
variable

export PYTHONPATH='/home/.../pyb00st_pygatt/'
